#Mastermind
In this task we wrote the Mastermind game, but in a different version.
The guesser - in our project called 'smart guesser' - chooses a series of numbers between 0-9 with repetition, at most 4 length, in less then 100 turns.
Our algorithm does it in maximus 34 turns (depends on the length), and in general, 
if the length is n, it does it in n! + 10. Not very efficient, but does the work.
